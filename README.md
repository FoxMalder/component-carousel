# Flexicarousel

A carousel that'll dynamically adapt its width: it will grow or shrink alongside a site thatâ€™s resizing via css media queries. Uses CSS3 transforms for its transitions

Much of this code was Inspired by:

## Known Issues
There's a memory leak at the moment. Each prev/next click triggers a CSS transition, but something's not getting cleaned up afterwards. 

## Examples

## Release History
### 0.1.1
Updated CSS so that only animating relevant properties. Gives much needed performance gain and no stutter-y z-index issues.
